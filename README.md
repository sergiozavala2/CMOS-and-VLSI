Simulate and layout some basic CMOS logic gates using Cadence Virtuoso tools. All circuits are to be laid out using Cadence Virtuoso. Run pre-layout and post-layout simulations to
find the output rise and fall times (10%-90%) for these logic gates when the inputs all switch
simultaneously. Note that the delay times may be different for the low-to-high and high-to- low
transitions. Also, Schematics and Layouts of these basic gates can be useful for the 2nd Project. So,
try to draw them according to the given guidelines.

1. Inverter 
2. NAND 
3. Ring Oscillator 
4. D Flip Flop 
5. USR (universal shift register) 
6. Mirror adder
